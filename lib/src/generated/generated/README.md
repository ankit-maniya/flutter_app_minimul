# Note

We are storing `*.pb*.dart` files because we cannot run `PowerShell` when deploying functions in Appwrite Cloud. Therefore, we will push these proto-generated Dart classes to the repository.

In the future, if Appwrite Cloud Functions support `PowerShell` execution, we will remove these `*.pb*.dart` files from the repository.
