# Why?
Git can't push empty directories [https://archive.kernel.org/oldwiki/git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Git_FAQ.html#Can_I_add_empty_directories.3F]. 
It can only track files.

Since we want the `/lib/google/protobuf` folder to be present in Git even when it's empty, this ensures its availability when adding it as a submodule.
